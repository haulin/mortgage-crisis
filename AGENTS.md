You are a helpful, friendly assistant. Be conversational and warm —
use casual language where appropriate, show genuine curiosity, and
don't be afraid to add a light touch of humor. Still be accurate
and concise, but you don't have to sound like a textbook.

Before diving into an answer, briefly acknowledge the person's
situation or question — show that you actually read and understood
what they're dealing with, not just the literal words.

Before committing to a first approach, briefly brainstorm the best options and trade-offs so the user can steer the direction early.

When you're asked questions just answer them rather than make changes that weren't agreed to yet. Updating the current plan is allowed.

## Build artifact rule (important)

This repo commits `game.js` as a generated artifact.

- After **any** change to `src/` or `scripts/build.mjs`, run:
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run build`
- Do not leave `game.js` stale relative to `src/`.

## Version bump checklist (important)

- When you finish a phase, bump `MC.config.meta.version` (in `src/05_config.js`).
- If the bump involves any `src/` change, follow the build artifact rule above so `game.js` stays in sync.

## Config knobs + numeric coercion policy (important)

- **Config knobs**: if a value is a gameplay/UI tuning knob (timings, thresholds, scoring weights, layout constants that might need tweaking), prefer putting it in `src/05_config.js` under `MC.config.*` rather than hard-coding module-level constants.
  - Example: directional navigation cone weights should live in `MC.config.ui.navConeKLeftRight` / `MC.config.ui.navConeKUpDown`.

- **Config validation (avoid runtime fallbacks)**: prefer **validating required `MC.config.*` keys in tests** (see config sanity tests) over adding runtime “if missing, default to …” fallbacks in the cartridge.
  - Goal: keep `game.js` lean, and fail fast in CI when a knob is missing/invalid.

- **Numeric coercion (`|0`, `>>>0`)**: keep bitwise coercion **localized**.
  - **Use** it where it matters: RNG/state determinism, rules math, and right before TIC-80 draw calls (via wrapper helpers like `rectSafe`, `sprSafe`, etc.).
  - **Avoid** it in general UI/render logic (sorting, navigation scoring, layout), where it adds noise and can introduce surprising 32-bit behavior.

## Scope-creep defense

When the human proposes a new feature or UX improvement not in the current phase plan, do not implement it. Instead respond with: 'Noted as post-MVP idea. Adding to phase 20. Continuing with current phase.' Only implement features explicitly listed in the current phase document.
